 *
 * When used correctly __builtin_unreachable() allows the compiler
 * to generate slightly better code and eliminates some warnings
 * when the compiler can't identify a "fallthrough" path that is
 * never reached.
 *
 * When used incorrectly, __builtin_unreachable is a dangerous
 * construct and we should structure code in such a way that we
 * need fewer instances of NOT_REACHED to silence the compiler,
 * and use the function attribute "noreturn" where appropriate
 * and potentially then using NOT_REACHED as documentation.
 *
 * We should *never* have code after NOT_REACHED in a block as
 * it's unclear to the reader if that path is ever possible, and
 * as mentioned above, gcc will do weird and wonderful things to us.
 *
 * Mainly, we want the compiler to infer the same control-flow
 * information as it would from Panic().  Otherwise, different
 * compilation options will lead to different control-flow-derived
 * errors, causing some make targets to fail while others succeed.
 *
 * VC++ has the __assume() built-in function which we don't trust
 * (see bug 43485); gcc has no such construct; we just panic in
 * userlevel code.  The monitor doesn't want to pay the size penalty
 * (measured at 212 bytes for the release vmm for a minimal infinite
 * loop; panic would cost even more) so it does without and lives
 * with the inconsistency.
