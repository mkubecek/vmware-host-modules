# dkms-setup.sh - Configure DKMS hooks for the VMware kernel modules
#
# Usage: dkms-setup.sh [OPTIONS]
#   OPTIONS:
#   -u, --update  Remove older versions of the VMware modules from the DKMS tree
#                 before installing the newest. Operations will only be applied
#                 on the currently running kernel.
#   -h, --help    Show this help and exit.
#
# This script handles
#  - VMware version detection
#  - Checking out and applying needed patches from mkubecek/vmware-host-modules
#  - Adding, building, and installing the modules through DKMS so that they
#    will be automatically updated when new kernels are installed on the system
#  - Automatic removal of older VMware module versions from the DKMS tree 
#    *for the currently running kernel ONLY*
#
# This script does *not* handle
#  - Package dependencies. `git' and `dkms' are of course required, as are 
#    your distribution's linux headers, kernel build system, and C compiler.
#    Additional dependencies will vary.
#  - Removal of older modules for other kernel versions. There are simply too
#    many ways to unintentionally screw up someone's setup this way--it's
#    easier to manage more complex cases directly through the DKMS CLI.
#  - Updating the secure boot configuration to allow loading self-signed
#    kernel modules. Having a user reboot into their UEFI firmware to enroll
#    a new MOK certificate is outside the scope of this script. DKMS will 
#    automatically sign newly compiled modules (and generate a signing key, 
#    if needed). Usually, it will place the public/private key pair at
#    /var/lib/dkms/mok.{pub,key}, but can also be configured to use an existing
#    keypair through the $mok_signing_key and $mok_certificate variables in
#    /etc/dkms/framework.conf.d
